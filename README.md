# PythonAlgorithms
My library of algorithm implementations for competitive programming in Python.
Most available libraries for competitive programming are written in C++, so I created one for Python. Even though python is slower than C++ it can be easier to do some implementations (especially handling large numbers or floats) and it is more approachable for beginners. And it has defaultdict which is my favorite data structure + lru_cache is awsome
